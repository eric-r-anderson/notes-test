Git Glossary

remote: A remote is a repository stored on another computer, often on GitHub's 
server. It is standard practice (and also the default when you clone a 
repository) to give the name origin to the remote that points to your main 
offsite repository (for example, your GitHub repository).
Git supports multiple remotes. This is commonly used when forking a repository.
