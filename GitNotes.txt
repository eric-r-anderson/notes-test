Git Notes

Introduction
Getting Started shows steps to create a repository for this document, and an
initial commit and push.  The repository name is notes-test.  Branching tells 
how to create a branch, switch between branches, and merge.

Getting Started
Create and configure github account following instructions online (not given here).
To create the repository  notes-test for this document:

Go to the directory ~/.../notes-test and do:
git init

Create a file:
touch README  
# creates README

Commit:
git add README
# Stages README, adding it to the list of files to be committed
git commit -m 'first commit'
# Commits files, adding the message "first commit"

If you modified several files, but have created no new files, you can do:
git commit -a
# stages any modifed (but not new) files

Multi-line commit message
git commit -m 'commit title

commit description'

Push:
git remote add origin https://github.com/eric-r-anderson/notes-test.git
# create remote named "origin" pointing at your repo
git push origin master
# sends your commits in the "master" branch to GitHub

Branching
git checkout -b branch-for-branch 
# Creates a new branch called "branch-for-branch" and makes it the active branch

Make some changes now that won't effect the master branch.
Use checkout to switch between branches.

git push origin branch-for-branch
# push changes to branch-for-branch, and make branch-for-branch show up  on GitHub

Merge the changes into the master branch:
git checkout master 
# Makes "master" the active branch 
git merge branch-for-branch 
# Merges the commits from "branch-for-branch" into "master" 
git branch -d branch-for-branch 
# Deletes the "branch-for-branch " branch

git push origin --delete branch-for-branch
# delete the remote branch



Conclusion
This is the original conclusion.
