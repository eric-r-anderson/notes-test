This repository is all about the text file:
GitNotes.txt

It contains notes on Git and I'm using it to familiarize myself with using Git and GitHub.

Originally started this with a open document file:

NotesTest.odt

but ran into difficulties with merging, and since the point of this excercise
is to learn git commands, I decided not to struggle with figuring out how to 
diff and merge this other type of document.  Now I'm sticking with the simple 
text file GitNotes.txt
